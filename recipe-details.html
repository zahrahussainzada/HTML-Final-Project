    <b>Ingredients:</b><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough
            <ul>
                <li> 1 cup (240 mL) lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1¬Ω Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1¬Ω tsp (9 g) salt</li>
                <li>¬Ω tsp active dry yeast</li>
                <li>3 cups + 1 Tbsp (420 g) bread flour </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Filling
            <ul>
                <li>2 large potatoes, peeled, cut into 1 cm cubes</li>
                <li>6 stalks green onion, sliced<sup>‚Ä†</sup> </li>
                <li>1 cup (16 g) fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>1 green chili pepper, minced</li>
                <li>1 tsp (2 g) ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 tsp (6 g) salt</li>
                <li>¬Ω tsp ground turmeric</li>
                <li>¬Ω tsp ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2¬Ω Tbsp (37 mL) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
    </ul><br>
    <p><b>Instructions: </b>
        <ol>
            <li>To a large bowl, add the water, oil, salt, and yeast. Stir.</li><br>
            <li>Then add the flour. Mix well.</li><br>
            <li>Then knead the dough for a few minutes, until soft and elastic*. <br>
                Add a bit more flour as needed if the dough is too sticky. Cover <br>
                with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water for 15 <br>
                minutes. When the potatoes are fully cooked through, drain and transfer <br>
                to a large bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Add the green onion, cilantro, chili pepper, and spices to the bowl as <br>
                well. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few <br>
                lumps remain.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the dough into 8 pieces.</li><br>
            <li>Roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Dust each ball with flour.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle flour on your working surface. Use a rolling pin to roll each <br>
                ball into a thin circle about 20 - 22 cm in diameter, about as thin as <br>
                a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not too thin that it will rip if <br>
                handled.</li><br>
            <li>Gently lift the rolled-out dough and re-flour your working surface. Spread <br>
                ‚Öì cup of the potato filling over half of the dough, leaving a ¬Ω inch (1 cm) <br>
                border along the edge. Dip your fingers in water and spread the water along <br> 
                this edge, only on one half of the circle.</li><br>
            <li>Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. Press <br> 
                out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal <br>
                the bolani.</li><br>
            <li>Add a bit of the oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the <br>
                bolani to the pan. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry  <br>
                brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani.</li><br>
            <li>When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. <br>
                Then transfer to a cooling rack. Continue with the remaining bolani.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy!</li><br>

<!-- 0. div tag can be used but then we have to use css inline style to make sections
 id="parent".
1. div is like a room and id is like label. 
2. style="display: means how to show what is inside the room. means it displays
whatever is inside the div on a browser the way we want. 
3. flex:  means to show what is inside div side by side like column.
4. style="flex-basis: 50%; means my preferred width size of the column. 
5. flex-grow: 1; means sharing and using extra space equally. 
6. flex-shrink: 1;" means if there wasn't enough space both sides should get reduced as much as needed.
7: We use div and flexbox layout as css inline style.
8: inline: to used directly inside html tag without using it in a separate block.
